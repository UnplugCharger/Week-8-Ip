Question
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

What is hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones to meet the needs of the body. The thyroid is underactive.

Causes Hypothyroidism can occur if the thyroid gland fails to work properly, or if the thyroid gland is not stimulated properly by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland.

Hashimoto’s disease The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. is Hashimoto’s disease, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis.

Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune disease, a disorder in which the immune system attacks the body’s own cells and organs.

The condition causes the immune system to attack the thyroid gland, leading to inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones.

Thyroiditis Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. It causes thyroid hormones to leak into the blood, raising their overall levels and leading to hyperthyroidism. After 1 to 2 months, this may develop into hypothyroidism.

Thyroiditis can be caused by viral or bacterial infection, an autoimmune condition or following pregnancy.

Congenital hypothyroidism In cases of congenital hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland does not function properly from birth.

This can lead to physical and mental growth problems, but early treatment can prevent these complications. Most newborns in the U.S. are screened for hypothyroidism.

Metricst of success our modl will be evaluated on the accuracy .. we are aimming at the highest accuracy possible since this is a question to do with health and it is a sensitive matter
